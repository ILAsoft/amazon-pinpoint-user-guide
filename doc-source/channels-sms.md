# Amazon Pinpoint SMS Channel<a name="channels-sms"></a>

You can enable the SMS channel in Amazon Pinpoint to send text messages, or *SMS messages*, to SMS\-enabled devices\.

For many use cases, you must [enable SMS options with AWS Support](channels-sms-awssupport.md) before you use Amazon Pinpoint to send SMS messages\. For example, to enable two\-way SMS, you must first obtain a dedicated origination number from AWS Support\. 

You can [manage SMS channel settings](channels-sms-manage.md) for your use case and budget\. For example, you can specify your monthly spending limit, and you can define keywords and responses for two\-way SMS\.

**Note**  
Your SMS channel settings apply to all SMS messages that you send from your AWS account\. This includes messages sent with AWS services other than Amazon Pinpoint\.

Where required by local laws and regulations \(such as the US and Canada\), SMS recipients can [opt out](channels-sms-manage.md#channels-sms-manage-optout), which means that they choose to stop receiving SMS messages from your AWS account\. 

You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send SMS messages to more than 200 countries and/or regions\. For more information, see [Supported Countries and Regions](channels-sms-countries.md)\.

A user *segment* represents a subset of your audience based on shared characteristics, such as how recently the users have used your application or which device platform they use\. A segment designates who receives the messages delivered by a campaign\. Define segments so that you can reach the right audience when you want to invite users back to your application, make special offers, or otherwise increase user engagement and purchasing\.

# Setting up the Amazon Pinpoint Email Channel<a name="channels-email-setup"></a>

To set up the Amazon Pinpoint email channel, you [create a new project](channels-email-setup-create.md), and then verify an email address to use when sending email from that project\.

When you enable the email channel for the first time, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't immediately provide production access for email messaging\. Instead, your AWS account has access only to the email sandbox, which imposes restrictions on your email traffic\. To gain production access, [submit a sending limit increase request](channels-email-setup-production-access.md) through AWS Support\.

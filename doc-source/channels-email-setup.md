# Setting up the Amazon Pinpoint Email Channel<a name="channels-email-setup"></a>

To set up the Amazon Pinpoint email channel, you [create a project in AWS Mobile Hub](channels-email-setup-create.md), enable the email channel for that project, and verify your email address or domain\.

When you enable the email channel for the first time, Amazon Pinpoint does not immediately provide production access for email messaging\. Instead, your AWS account has access only to the email sandbox, which imposes restrictions on your email traffic\. To gain production access, [submit a sending limit increase request](channels-email-setup-production-access.md) through AWS Support\.

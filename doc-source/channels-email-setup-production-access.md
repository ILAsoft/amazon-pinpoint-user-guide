# Requesting Production Access for Email<a name="channels-email-setup-production-access"></a>

We use a sandbox environment to help protect our customers from fraud and abuse\. The sandbox environment also helps you establish your sender reputation with ISPs and email recipients\. New Amazon Pinpoint email user accounts are placed in the sandbox environment\. While your account is in the sandbox, you have full access to Amazon Pinpoint email sending methods, with the following restrictions: 
+ You can only send email from verified addresses and domains\.
+ You can only send email to addresses that you have verified, or to addresses associated with the mailbox simulator\.
+ You can send a maximum of 200 messages per 24\-hour period\.
+ You can send a maximum of one message per second\.

To remove these restrictions, see [Opening a Sending Limits Increase Case](channels-email-manage-limits.md#channels-email-manage-limits-increase-case)\.

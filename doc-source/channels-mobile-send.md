# Sending Email in Amazon Pinpoint<a name="channels-mobile-send"></a>

There are two types of email that you can send using Amazon Pinpoint: campaign\-based email, and transactional email\. *Campaign\-based emails* are messages that are sent either one time or on a recurring schedule, and that target customers based on their attributes\. *Transactional emails* are sent one time only, and are typically sent in response to another action occurring\. For example, you can use transactional messages to send an email when a customer chooses the "Forgot my password" link in your app, or to send a confirmation when a customer places an order on your site\.

In Amazon Pinpoint, you typically use the web\-based management console to send campaign\-based emails, whereas transactional emails are usually sent from applications that use an AWS SDK, or that call the Amazon Pinpoint API directly\.

When you send a campaign\-based email, you first create a [segment](segments-building.md)\. A segment is a group of recipients for the campaign\. Next, you create a campaign\. In Amazon Pinpoint, a campaign consists of one or more target segments, a message, and a delivery schedule for that message\. To learn more about creating campaigns, see [Amazon Pinpoint Campaigns](campaigns.md)\.

To send a transactional email, you can use the `SendMessage` operation Amazon Pinpoint API\. To learn more about using the Amazon Pinpoint API, see the [Amazon Pinpoint API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/)\. You can also send transactional email by using the [Amazon Pinpoint SMTP interface](channels-email-send-smtp.md)\.

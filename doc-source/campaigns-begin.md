# Step 1: Create a Campaign<a name="campaigns-begin"></a>

The first step in setting up a campaign is to create a new campaign\. When you create a new campaign, you give the campaign a name, and specify whether it should be a standard campaign or an A/B test campaign\. \(In an A/B test campaign, you create several versions of a message to compare their performance\.\)

**To begin creating a campaign**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. On the **Projects** page, choose the project that you want to create the campaign in\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Campaigns**\.

1. Choose **Create a campaign**\.

1. For **Campaign name**, type a descriptive name for the campaign\. Using a descriptive name makes it easier to find or search for the campaign later\.

1. For **Campaign type**, choose one of the following options:
   + **Standard campaign** – Sends a message to a segment on a schedule that you define\.
   + **A/B Test** – Behaves like a standard campaign, but enables you to define different treatments for the campaign's message or schedule\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

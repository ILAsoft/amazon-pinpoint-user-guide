You can also configure certain settings for individual campaigns\. When you change settings at the campaign level, those settings override the settings for the project that the campaign resides in\.

Some settings related to sending SMS messages apply to all projects in your Amazon Pinpoint account, and to other AWS services that send SMS messages\. These settings are shown in the **Account\-level settings** section of the **Edit SMS Settings** page\.

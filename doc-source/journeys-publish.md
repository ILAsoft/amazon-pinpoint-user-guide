# Publish a Journey<a name="journeys-publish"></a>

When you've [tested your journey](journeys-review-test.md#journeys-test) and you're ready for customers to enter it, you can publish the journey\. The publishing process requires you to complete the review process one more time\.

**To publish a journey**

1. In the upper\-right corner of the journey workspace, choose **Review**\. The **Review your journey** pane appears on the left side of the journey workspace\.

1. Review the error messages that are shown on the first page of the **Review your journey** pane\. You can't launch your journey until you resolve all of the issues that are shown on this pane\. If there are no issues with your journey, you see a message stating that your journey doesn't contain any errors\. When you're ready to proceed, choose **Next**\.

1. The second page of the **Review your journey** pane contains recommendations and best practices that are relevant to your journey\. You can proceed without resolving the issues that are shown on this page\. When you're ready to proceed, choose **Mark as reviewed**\.

1. On the third page of the **Review your journey** pane, choose **Publish**\.
**Note**  
Even if you configure the journey to begin immediately, there is a 5 minute delay before participants actually enter the journey\. During this delay, Amazon Pinpoint calculates all of the segment members, and prepares to start capturing analytics data\. This delay also gives you a final opportunity to cancel the journey if necessary\.

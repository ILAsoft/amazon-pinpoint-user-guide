# Amazon Pinpoint Message Templates<a name="messages-templates"></a>

If you frequently design and send a certain type of message, such as a weekly newsletter or an appointment reminder, you can create and save it as a message template\. You can then use the template as a starting point each time you need to create that type of message, instead of designing and writing the message again\.

A *message template* is a set of content that you can create, save, and then reuse in messages that you send for any of your Amazon Pinpoint projects\. When you create a template, you specify the content that you want to reuse in various components of messages that are based on the template\. These components, referred to as *template parts*, can be the subject or title of a message, the body of a message, or both\. For push notifications, template parts can also specify settings such as a custom sound to play or an image to display when a recipient receives a push notification that's based on the template\.

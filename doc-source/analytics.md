# Amazon Pinpoint Analytics<a name="analytics"></a>

Using the analytics provided by Amazon Pinpoint, you can gain insight into your user base by viewing trends related to user engagement, campaign outreach, revenue, and more\.

As users interact with your application, the application can report data to Amazon Pinpoint that you can view to learn about your users' [level of engagement](analytics-usage.md), [purchase activity](analytics-revenue.md), and [demographics](analytics-demographics.md)\. For example, you can view charts that show how many users open your app each day, the times at which users open your app, and the revenue generated by your app\. By viewing charts about device attributes, you can learn which platforms and devices your app is installed on\.

You can monitor [campaign analytics](analytics-campaigns.md) to see how your campaigns are performing in aggregate as well as individually\. You can follow the total number of push notifications sent, the percentage of push notifications that resulted in opening the app, opt\-out rates, and other information\. If you created a campaign that includes an A/B test, you can use analytics to compare the effectiveness of the campaign treatments\. For example, you can assess whether users are more likely to open your app as a result of a variation on your campaign message\.

You can create and monitor [funnels](analytics-funnels.md) to analyze how many users are completing each step in a conversion process, such as purchasing an item or upgrading your app\.

To analyze or store the analytics data outside of Amazon Pinpoint, you can configure Amazon Pinpoint to [stream the data to Amazon Kinesis](analytics-streaming.md)\.

To report metrics from your mobile app, your app must be integrated with Amazon Pinpoint through one of the supported AWS Mobile SDKs\. For more information, see [Integrating Amazon Pinpoint With Your App](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/mobile-sdk.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.

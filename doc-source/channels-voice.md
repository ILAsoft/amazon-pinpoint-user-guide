# Amazon Pinpoint Voice Channel<a name="channels-voice"></a>

You can use the voice channel to create voice messages from a text script, and then deliver those messages to your customers over the phone\. The voice channel is a great way to reach customers whose phone numbers aren't able to receive SMS messages \(for example, users who use landlines or VoIP services\)\.

Currently, you can only send voice messages by using the Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice API\. However, you can use the Amazon Pinpoint console to request dedicated phone numbers for sending voice messages\. For more information about managing the voice channel by using the console, see [Managing the Amazon Pinpoint Voice Channel](channels-voice-manage.md)\.

To learn more about sending messages by using the Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice API, see the [Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint-sms-voice/latest/APIReference/)\.

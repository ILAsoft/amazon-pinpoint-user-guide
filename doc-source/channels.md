# Amazon Pinpoint Channels<a name="channels"></a>

A *channel* represents the platform through which you engage your audience segment with messages\. For example, to send push notifications to users of your apps, you must have an Amazon Pinpoint project in which the *push notifications* channel is enabled\. Amazon Pinpoint supports the following channel types:
+ [Mobile push](channels-mobile.md)
+ [Email](channels-email.md)
+ [SMS](channels-sms.md)

Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to engage your audience, you have to create an Amazon Pinpoint project, and that project has to support one or more channels\.

After you create a project and enable a channel, you can use your project to send messages\. You can [define the audience segment](segments.md) that you want to engage and then [define a campaign](campaigns.md) that sends messages to that segment\. Or, to send a message to a limited audience, you can [send a test message](messages.md) without creating a campaign\.
